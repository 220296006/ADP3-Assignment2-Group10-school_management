The changes to help us improve is that we should have communicated more because there was a delay in the assignment due to group members not responding and sharing their work causing the whole assignment to be a day delayed. Communication also helps other members from the group to assist other members with tasks so that everyone can be on par with a good understanding. The challenges we faced were connecting the database and because all of our IServices were different it clashed and caused errors when merged to the master. Some of us had problems creating a pull request or pushing to the master. Not all the Entity domains have Primary keys / identifiers so it is challenging to make the connection between the 2 enities.

Domain entities, most of the time, can be combined into one entity. When different domains center around one particular domain  this can cause a situation for having too many domains. The employee and student domain in this instance could be combined to create a user domain then the different goals for each user(i.e. Employee or student) could just be stated and this can eliminate having too many and/or unnecessary domains.


In the school management domain problem, the erd model is designed to be loosely coupled with good aggregation relationships between domain entities. The city should have an aggregation relation to address and country because if you delete country or address or both the city will also be deleted.
